# **Twitter Trending Hashtags**

An application to generate and retrieve a list of the most popular trending hashtags from simulated tweets. The application is designed to be fast, scalable, and durable using Redis for state storage and in-memory processing.

---

## **Features**

- **POST /tweet**: Accepts tweets and extracts hashtags for processing.
- **GET /trending-hashtags**: Retrieves the top 25 trending hashtags in descending order.
- Uses Redis Bloom Filter to deduplicate tweets and Redis Top-K to maintain trending hashtags efficiently.
- Supports high loads with asynchronous processing.
- Data persists across service restarts.

---

## **Requirements**

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **Redis** (with RedisBloom module installed)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

---

## **Installation**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepakdantagani1/twitter-trending-hashtags.git
cd twitter-trending-hashtags
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Redis
- Ensure Redis is installed and running.
- If RedisBloom is not installed, add it by following the [RedisBloom Documentation](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom).

   To start and set up Redis with the required data structures, follow these steps, including the first Redis CLI command:

### **Step 1: Start the Redis Server**
Make sure the Redis server is running before you proceed with initializing the Bloom Filter and Top-K data structures. Use the following command to start Redis:

```bash
redis-server
```

---

### **Step 2: Connect to the Redis CLI**
After starting the Redis server, open a Redis CLI session to execute commands:

```bash
redis-cli
```

---

### **Step 3: Initialize the Bloom Filter**
Set up the Bloom Filter to deduplicate tweets. For example:

```plaintext
BF.RESERVE BLOOM_FILTER_KEY 0.01 100000
```

---

### **Step 4: Initialize the Top-K Data Structure**
Set up the Top-K data structure to track the most popular hashtags. For example:

```plaintext
TOPK.RESERVE TOP_K_KEY 25 200 5 0.9
```

4. **Configure environment variables (if needed):**
   - Default Redis URL is `redis://localhost:6379`.
     REDIS_URL=redis://<your-redis-url>:6379
     ```

#### **Step 1: Start the Redis Server**
Start the Redis server using the following command:
```bash
redis-server
```

#### **Step 2: Connect to the Redis CLI**
Open the Redis CLI:
```bash
redis-cli
```

#### **Step 3: Initialize the Bloom Filter**
Set up the Bloom Filter to deduplicate tweets:
```plaintext
BF.RESERVE BLOOM_FILTER_KEY 0.01 100000
```

#### **Step 4: Initialize the Top-K Data Structure**
Set up the Top-K data structure to track the most popular hashtags:
```plaintext
TOPK.RESERVE TOP_K_KEY 25 200 5 0.9
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
- The default Redis URL is `redis://localhost:6379`.
- If needed, configure `REDIS_URL`:
  ```bash
  REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
  ```

### 5. Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

---

## **Usage**

### **1. Create a Tweet**
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/tweets`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "tweet": "This is a tweet with #RedisBloom and #TopK"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Tweet received for processing."
}
```

---

### **2. Get Trending Hashtags**
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/hashtags`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "hashtags": [
    { "hashtag": "#topk", "count": 100 },
    { "hashtag": "#redisbloom", "count": 90 }
  ]
}
```

---

## **Technical Details**

### **How It Works**

1. **Bloom Filter for Deduplication:**
   - Uses Redis Bloom Filter (`BLOOM_FILTER_KEY`) to avoid processing duplicate tweets efficiently.
   - Minimizes memory usage and ensures near-constant lookup time for deduplication.

2. **Top-K for Trending Hashtags:**
   - Uses Redis Top-K data structure (`TOP_K_KEY`) to track and rank the most popular hashtags with approximate counts.

3. **Asynchronous Processing:**
   - Tweets are processed in the background to ensure quick response times.

4. **Durability:**
   - Redis persists Bloom Filter and Top-K data structures to ensure data is retained across service restarts.

---

## **Scaling and Performance**

- **Handles High Loads:** Designed to handle several requests per second by leveraging asynchronous processing and Redis for state management.
- **Efficient Algorithms:** Redis Bloom Filter and Top-K structures use approximate algorithms to ensure low computational overhead.
- **Distributed Redis:** Can be extended with Redis clustering to handle high-scale environments.

## **Production-Level Design**

### **High-Level Architecture**
The production-ready design scales seamlessly for high loads and ensures fault tolerance. It uses **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** for container orchestration and integrates AWS-managed services for reliability.

#### **Components**

1. **AWS Load Balancer:**
   - **AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)** serves as the entry point, routing client requests to Kubernetes services.

2. **Kubernetes Cluster (Amazon EKS):**
   - Hosts the following microservices:
     - **Tweet API Service:** Handles incoming tweets and deduplication.
     - **Hashtag Processor Service:** Updates Redis with hashtags asynchronously.
     - **Trending API Service:** Fetches the top 25 hashtags from Redis.

3. **Data Storage (Redis):**
   - **BLOOM_FILTER_KEY:** Ensures tweets are processed only once.
   - **TOP_K_KEY:** Efficiently tracks and ranks the top hashtags.

4. **Messaging (Kafka):**
   - Decouples data ingestion and processing for high throughput and fault tolerance.

5. **Monitoring and Security:**
   - **CloudWatch Logs:** Captures logs for debugging and auditing.

---

### **Data Flow**

1. **Tweet Ingestion:**
   - Client sends a `POST /tweet` request.
   - Tweet API checks `BLOOM_FILTER_KEY` for deduplication and publishes hashtags to Kafka.

2. **Hashtag Processing:**
   - Kafka consumers update `TOP_K_KEY` in Redis with hashtag counts.

3. **Trending Hashtag Retrieval:**
   - Trending API fetches the top 25 hashtags from `TOP_K_KEY` in Redis.

---

### **Scalability**

1. **Kubernetes Autoscaling:**
   - Automatically scales pod replicas based on CPU and memory usage.

2. **Redis Scaling:**
   - Extend Redis with clustering for horizontal scaling.

3. **Kafka Scaling:**
   - Increase Kafka partitions and brokers for high-throughput messaging.
